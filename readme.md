# Express.js Learning Project

Welcome to the Express.js Learning Project! This project is designed to help you understand the basics of Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, cookies, sessions, and CRUD operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Install dependencies:


3. Start the server:


4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Project Structure

This project follows the structure created by Express Generator. Here's a brief overview of the directory structure:

- `bin`: Contains the main executable file for the application.
- `public`: Contains static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
- `routes`: Contains route definitions for different parts of the application.
- `views`: Contains the EJS templates for rendering HTML pages.
- `app.js`: Main entry point of the application where Express middleware and routes are configured.

## Connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose

This project demonstrates how to connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine. Then, update the `config/db.js` file with your MongoDB connection URI.

## Cookies and Sessions

This project implements user authentication using cookies and sessions. The `express-session` middleware is used for session management, while `cookie-parser` middleware is used for parsing cookies.

## CRUD Operations

The project includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data. Routes for CRUD operations can be found in the `routes` directory.
